More than a half of the songs ave been released in the last 6 years. Most songs have been been released in october. The beginning of autumn seems to be a good time for spreading music.

**How are danceability and energy are connected?**

Intuitively, I would say there is a connection between the energy of a song and its danceability. Could we find evidence for that looking at the following figures?

Most of the songs in the data set have a medium to high energy and danceability! Also, quite silimar distribution, could be a hint, that there is connection.
